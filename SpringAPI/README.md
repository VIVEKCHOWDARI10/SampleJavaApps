CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, Argo CD & AWS EKS
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline following DevOps and GitOps principles.
The pipeline automates application build, Docker image creation, image push to Docker Hub, and Kubernetes deployment on AWS EKS using Argo CD.

Jenkins is used for Continuous Integration (CI), while Argo CD handles Continuous Deployment (CD) by monitoring Kubernetes manifest changes.
